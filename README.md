# Chess-League

This Java project incorporates various concepts of OOP and can be used to conduct/organize a chess league.

The system ensures random generation of fixtures in order to avoid any form of biased circumstances or unfair situations. All the registered players will play against each other in a round-robin format and after the league phase gets over, the player who tops the points table is declared the winner. A player earns 3 points for winning a match and 0 for losing a match. In case of a drawn match, 
each player earns 1 point.

There are two sections in this system: one is for the coordinators and the other one is open to all. The coordinators' section can be 
accessed only through login credentials. The other section is not password protected and can be accessed directly to see the list of
fixtures and the points table.

The following operations/functionalities are available in this system:
* Adding a player (Registration of players)
* Showing a list of registered players
* Editing/Updating the details of the registered players
* Removing a registered player
* Finding a registered player in the record
* Generating fixtures
* Generating points table
* Updating details of fixtures
* Displaying all the fixtures
* Displaying the points table
